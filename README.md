🌍 Global Voice of the People (GVOP)

An AI-powered platform that captures, analyzes, and visualizes global public sentiment — beyond biased news and media narratives.

🚨 Problem

Mainstream media and social platforms often show:

Biased reporting

Limited geographic or demographic coverage

Over-representation of elite or Western voices

As a result, the true voice of people across the world is lost.

💡 Solution

GVOP aggregates real-time opinions, reactions, and narratives from:

News

Social media

Public platforms

Global sources

It then uses AI & NLP to:

Detect sentiment

Extract key topics

Identify bias

Visualize trends

All in one interactive dashboard.
